= SoftHalfDuplexSerial Library for Arduino =

 This library implement all the required operation to drive Dynamixel servo,
 using only one wire.
 It required the halfDuplexSerial lib (SoftHalfDuplexSerial.cpp & .h)
 Limitations:
  - The pin should support change interrupts (see halfDuplexSerial lib)
  - Baudrate is limited (57 600bps ~ 115 200bps for 16Mhz Arduino board)
  - 5V Arduino Board (I didn't try with 3.3V board as I didn't have one)
